This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the

Things you may want to cover:

* Technologies used are:
    Angular, Rails API, Angular-Filter, JQuery, HTML5, CSS

* Levels:
    MVP - MVP includes Rails API, Seed Data and 3 models
    Silver - Includes ratings for pet sitters and pets
    Gold - Includes Google maps to be used to find pet sitter and pets
    Diamond - Includes user authentication for pet sitters and pet owners.

* Our Web application
    We created a pet sitter web application where where a pet owner can locate a pet sitter and a pet sitter can locate a pet. We have three models (pet sitter, pet owner and pet) with pet owner and pet having a one to many relationship.
    In our application a pet owner is able to search for pet sitters by name and location(zipcode) by using a text search or a drop down list. A pet sitter is able to search by location and type of pet. We also included a filter to include or not include a pet that will need to be given medication.
